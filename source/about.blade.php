        <p>
            Hi, my name is Tomas. I'm European, with a Danish passport. I've been working in software development since
            the early 2000s.
            I was born and raised in Denmark, lived in Germany from June 2013 to February 2022, and now I'm back home in
            Denmark.
        </p>

        <p>
            I work as a freelancer in my company <a href="https://7th-green.com">7th Green</a>, specializing in PHP
            development and DevOps.
            My main strengths include TYPO3, PHP in general and DevOps.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here, I’ll share my thoughts, ideas, and a mix of topics—ranging from software to productivity and beyond.
            Let's see where this journey takes me.
        </p>
