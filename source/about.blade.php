    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="mb-6">
        Hi, my name is Tomas. I'm European, with a Danish passport. I've been working in software development since the early 2000s.
        I was born and raised in Denmark, lived in Germany from June 2013 to February 2022, and now I'm back home in Denmark.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        I work as a freelancer in my company <a href="https://7th-green.com">7th Green</a>, specializing in PHP development and DevOps.
        My main strengths include TYPO3, PHP in general and DevOps.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        Here, I’ll share my thoughts, ideas, and a mix of topics—ranging from software to productivity and beyond. Let's see where this journey takes me.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8">
