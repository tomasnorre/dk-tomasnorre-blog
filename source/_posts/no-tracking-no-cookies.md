As I want this blog to be as simple as possible, and I want to have it compliant with GDPR, I have decided to not have any tracking nor cookies.

The blog is a collection of static generated HTML files, so keeping it simple with only limited JavaScript. I am aware that GDPR compliant tracking like [fathom](https://usefathom.com/) but currently not willing to pay for a tracking service.
