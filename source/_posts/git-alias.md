Git is an amazing tool, I personally use a `git wip` alias all the time, which gives a nice overview of which branches have been worked on lately.

```bash
$ git wip
  6 months ago	ci-phpstan-fix
  4 months ago	bugfix/update-label
  4 days ago	v11.x
  2 days ago	main
```

You can add following to your `~/.gitconfig` save and vol√° you're done, and ready to use it.

```ini
[alias]
  wip = for-each-ref --sort='authordate:iso8601' --format=' %(color:green)%(authordate:relative)%09%(color:white)%(refname:short)' refs/heads
```
