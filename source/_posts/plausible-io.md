I know I stated in my post [No Tracking, No Cookies](https://blog.tomasnorre.dk/blog/no-tracking-no-cookies/), that I didn't want to have any tracking. 
But I decided to test [plausible.io](https://plausible.io) to see if I generate any traffic at all on my site.

This is cheaper as [fathom](https://usefathom.com/) and with a 30 days trail, I could even test it before deciding.
