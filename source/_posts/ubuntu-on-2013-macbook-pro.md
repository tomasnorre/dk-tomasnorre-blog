I have an old MacBook Pro from 2013, which my girlfriend is using for yoga only. This has not become any updates for 
a long time. So now I have decided to "renew" it, with a fresh installation of Ubuntu Linux. 

Specs
``` 
Intel Duo Core 2.5 Ghz i5 
16 GB DDR3 1600 Mhz Memory
512 GB SSD
```

## Steps

### Backup

Take backup of what ever is on the system that you might need again.

### USB Drive 

Download the wanted Ubuntu version and flash it on a USB drive. I have choosen Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, to have as stable 
as possible. I flash my USB drives with the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)

### Installation

```text
1. Shut down your Mac: if it is on. 
2. Insert the bootable USB drive: into a USB port.
3. Press the power button: to turn on your Mac.
4. Immediately press and hold the Option (⌥) key: on your keyboard. 
5. Keep holding the Option key: until the Startup Manager screen appears, 
   which shows all available bootable drives.
6. Select the USB drive: from the options using your mouse or arrow keys.
7. Press Enter: or double-click the drive to boot from it. 
```

Run through the installation as you would on any other computer and reboot.

### Problems

I have read other tutorials and seen video, saying that the Camera and WiFi didn't work out of the box, but 
this wasn't the case for me. Everything worked like a charm, wit out any additional steps.

### Conclusion

The laptop feels like "new", it for sure have given it some extra years, I highly recommend it.
