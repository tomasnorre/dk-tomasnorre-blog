> I have always wanted to read more!

You know that feeling? I do very well. I have some "problems" that "keeps" me from reading more. This little post is about how I have tackled them.

First off, till this year I have finished one at max two books per year, and that I wanted to improve.

**What are the two biggest "problems" that I'm facing when trying to read?**

* I'm a slow reader, in my opinion (20 pages/hour)
* I get super easily distracted

**So how did I deal with this?**

Starting with "slow reader". This is of course subjective, but it often kept me from reading as I felt like I never got anywhere,
so I barely bothered starting reading.

There are techniques to improve one's reading speed. But I decided that the speed wasn't the biggest problem, but more an excuse for getting started.
End of 2020 I hear an Audio Book [Atomic Habits by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) which talked about
making a habit that small that you could do it every day without any chance of an excuse.

**What did I do?**

I started reading every night before going to bet. Just 5 minutes. So times I continued and read more, but 5 minutes was a minimum.
And 5 minutes I can always find, regardless how tired I'm.

After some time, I changed my goal to 10 minutes a day, as the 5 minutes was quite easy for me to "overcome".
This way I got started reading more.

**Distractions**

By moving my reading to the bed, I had close to no distractions. I did my reading before my girlfriend got to bet,
so no watches, no mobile phone, no nothing in the bedroom to distract me.

This is also something that `Atomic Habits` talks about, create your environment for success. If you get easily distracted like me,
It makes no sense trying to read in a room full of people talking. Set the stage and find a environment with a little as possible
distractions, then you will find it easier to reach your goal.

**Conclusion**

First, I don't care what you are reading, read what ever you like.

The result with these two small changes means that I as of today, I have read seven books this year so far, compared to normally one at best two
in a year.

I still have two more books that I want to finish this year, to reach a total of 9, I think I'll manage.
Even if not, it's still been a success.
