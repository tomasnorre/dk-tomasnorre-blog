I don't know if you are aware, but my blog is fully public at [https://github.com/tomasnorre/dk-tomasnorre-blog](https://github.com/tomasnorre/dk-tomasnorre-blog), you can have a peak, get inspired on how to setup your own blog.
You can copy/paste whatever you want from the set-up, not the content ;) . Have fun.
