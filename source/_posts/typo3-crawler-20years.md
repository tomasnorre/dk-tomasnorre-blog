On December 22nd, 2025, the TYPO3 Crawler officially turned 20 years old.

On that day back in 2005, the TYPO3 Crawler was uploaded publicly for the very first time. Since then, it has 
quietly but reliably done its job in countless TYPO3 installations making sure content gets indexed, updated, and delivered as expected. 
Twenty years is quite a milestone for any open-source extension.

I personally joined the journey much later. My first contribution was about 10 years ago, so I definitely can’t take 
credit for the full history or all the work that went into the Crawler over the years. Many developers before me laid 
the foundation, and many others have helped shape it along the way.

Like any long-lived project, the Crawler still has room for improvement. There are features to refine, technical debt to
address, and new TYPO3 versions to keep up with. I’m doing my best to maintain and evolve it in line with the needs of the TYPO3 community.

Thankfully, I’m not doing this alone. Contributions, bug reports, discussions, and pull requests from the community make
a huge difference—and I truly appreciate everyone who helps keep the Crawler alive and moving forward.

Here’s to 20 years of crawling… and many more to come.
