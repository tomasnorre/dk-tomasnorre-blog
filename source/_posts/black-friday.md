Instead of buying stuff you don't need anyway on Black Friday one should donate a little something to some of all 
the cool Open Source projects they use on regular basic.

I will personally donate some to: 

* [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit)
* [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan)
* [XDebug](https://github.com/xdebug)
* [Rector PHP](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector)
* [TYPO3 Rector](https://github.com/sabbelasichon/typo3-rector)

Thanks for all your work.
